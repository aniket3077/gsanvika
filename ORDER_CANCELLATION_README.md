# Order Cancellation Feature

## Overview

The Order Cancellation feature allows customers to cancel their orders before they are shipped, providing a smooth user experience and reducing customer service workload.

## Features

### üö´ Customer Order Cancellation
- **Self-Service**: Customers can cancel their own orders

- **Status Restrictions**: Only allows cancellation for "pending" and "processing" orders

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Quick Cancel
- **Admin Override**: Admins can quickly cancel orders
- **Batch Actions**: Cancel multiple orders if needed
- **Order Management**: Full control over order lifecycle

## User Experience

### Customer Cancellation Flow
1. **Access Order**: Navigate to order details or orders list
2. **Cancel Button**: Click "Cancel Order" button (only visible for eligible orders)
3. **Select Reason**: Choose from predefined reasons or provide custom reason
4. **Confirmation**: Review cancellation details and confirm
5. **Notification**: Receive success toast with refund information

### Cancellation Reasons
- Changed my mind
- Found a better price elsewhere
- Ordered by mistake
- Need to modify the order
- Delivery taking too long
- Payment issues
- Other (with custom text field)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### `CancelOrderButton` Component
- **Props**: 
  - `order`: Order object
  - `onOrderCancelled`: Callback function
  - `variant`: 'button' or 'link' style
  - `size`: Button size
- **Features**:
  - Reason selection dialog
  - Confirmation dialog with order summary
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Toast notifications

#### `QuickCancelButton` Component
- **Usage**: Admin-only quick cancellation
- **Features**: Simple confirmation dialog
- **Integration**: Admin orders page

### Firebase Service Integration

```typescript
// Cancel order method in FirebaseOrdersService
static async cancelOrder(orderId: string, cancellationReason?: string): Promise<void> {
  // Validates order status before cancellation
  // Updates order status to 'cancelled'
  // Adds cancellation reason to order notes
  // Updates timestamp
}
```

### Order Status Validation
- **Cancellable States**: "pending", "processing"
- **Non-Cancellable States**: "shipped", "delivered", "cancelled"
- **Real-time Updates**: UI automatically updates when order status changes

## Integration Points

### 1. Customer Order Detail Page (`/orders/[id]`)
- Cancel button appears in the order header next to status badges
- Only visible for eligible orders
- Refreshes order data after cancellation

### 2. Customer Orders List (`/orders`)
- Cancel button in each order card
- Inline with "View Details" button
- Quick access without navigating to detail page

### 3. Admin Orders Management (`/admin/orders`)
- Quick cancel button in actions column
- Streamlined for admin use
- Real-time order list updates

## Business Logic

### Cancellation Rules
1. **Time Window**: Orders can be cancelled until they are shipped
2. **Payment Status**: Both paid and unpaid orders can be cancelled
3. **Refund Processing**: Automatic refund initiation for completed payments
4. **Inventory**: Could integrate with inventory management (future enhancement)

### Status Transitions
```
